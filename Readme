Foruier series was used to fit the DFT data for shear strength calculations. Shear strength calculation procedure is explained in the following paper (10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109481). x- and y-data are the DFT total energy data given by taking a difference of E-E0, where E and E0 are the total energies at shear displacement d and 0, respectively.
